            <h3> Sentimental Analysis upon Tourism reviews using Data science</h3>
            <p>Sentiment analysis on tourism reviews using data science involves collecting reviews from various sources such as travel websites and social 
			media, then preprocessing the text data by removing punctuation, lowercasing, tokenizing, and eliminating stop words. Features are extracted using
			techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings, and machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, logistic regression, or
			deep learning models like RNN and LSTM are used for classification. The models are trained on labeled data and evaluated using metrics 
			like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Visualization tools help display sentiment distribution, word clouds, and trend analysis,
			providing insights into overall sentiment trends. These insights can improve services, tailor marketing strategies, offer competitor analysis,
			and enhance customer experiences, ultimately helping tourism businesses understand and respond to customer opinions better.</p>
